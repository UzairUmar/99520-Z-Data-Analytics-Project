I had to laugh... this morning at 5 am I was picking up breakfast from McDowells ... and when I start to deliver, the customer wanted to make sure they had 2 caramel sundaes. hahaha... say what now... I am so jealous to see those boost zones.. I get 1.1 like Thurs-Sun from 5-9 pm... and then from 4-8 am... never see multiples like what you get.   :(    I use the Uber map, but I like to use Google street view to see what the house looks like.  :)   Ya, it's hard to stop when the trips keep popping. That's a great days pay.  :)  I did $140 CAD last night in 6 hours... A lot of great tips though.  :)    Extra mile story... I picked up a shawarma delivery the other night. I could see through the plastic bag it was leaking allllll over. I said dude, you gotta change this container or something. He takes it out.. opens the Styrofoam container and says.. oh ya.. this customer wanted extra extra sauces.. dude.. this thing looked like a swimming pool. He wouldn't change the container but put in another bag. I told the customer about it and he was cool. He's like, don't worry man.. it wasn't your fault. Buddy gave me a $5 tip for that. So ya... a little extra customer service can pay off.  Keep up the great videos!",

Back then you would gets pieces of cucumber, carrots and other items etc. Now they barely put lettuce and if they do put it they give you barely any meat or chicken. Tell them you don't want salad and watch your plate look almost empty lol. They do however load you up with rice and bread. Makes you think why am I paying $9 for this when I used to get a whole lot more for $5 years ago.\n\nThe chicken is not really marinated. At least not on the original food carts. It's pretty much boiled chicken with maybe a little bit of black pepper and salt. Definitely not marinated. If you don't put the white sauce, hot sauce or the barbeque sauce the food will taste pretty bland to eat and hard to get it down without soda. The sauces are the only reason for the taste.\n\nA lot of these businesses initially tend to have good tasting food. When they get famous then they pretty much stop caring and just cash in on the name. They used to taste good long time ago. Now I don't see that many long lines there. And if there are any it's probably people who have never tried this place.\n\nI have gone to this place multiple times since I tried it first 20 years ago. The only reason I went there occasionally is because of friends and family pushing me to take them so they could at least try it for the first time. \n\nLike others on this comment section said there a whole lot of other place that have the same items that actually taste delicious and are well done. A lot of Turkish places taste really good.\n\nIf it wasn't for their unlimited sauces that you can pour yourself I doubt they'd be this famous.\n\nGo there for the experience. You might even like it. However I doubt you'll even miss it enough to go there every couple of months.",
